## Hi there 👋 It's Sylvain

I’m currently the Co-founder and CTO of [Canterly](http://canterly.com). I am a software engineer who's been at times a principal engineer, at times a senior manager and yet still feels like a junior 😅. I'm used to working on high-availability systems, which I did at [Grab](https;//grab.com) and [Thales](https://thalesgroup.com). I grew to enjoy focusing on engineering efficiency topics; devops, CI/CD, SRE.

I usually spend my free time working on the tools I love and use daily or on some projects of the moment, that I usually share here or on Gitlab 🤫. I’m a long time Linux 🐧 and Emacs enthousiast, normally running Arch but increasingly getting into Nix. I’ve been working on improving my note-taking workflows with `org-mode`, `org-roam` and [logseq](https://logseq.com). I recently got into Typescript and frontend development with React and NextJS for my new venture; and I'm loving it!

I used to maintain a C++ library called [Spatial](https://github.com/sbougerel/spatial) which was production-grade and used for research. I'm hoping to eventually get the time to revive it and modernize it, may be even port it to Rust.
